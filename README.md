## A Fully functional AI that enables the segregation of waste for efficient disposal
This is an example project titled WasteBot AI that enables the segregation of waste for efficient and convenent disposal while operating as a web app. The basic functions are as follows:
* To detect the type of waste and subsequently classify it into 6 different categories =>
  - cardboard
  - glass
  - metal
  - paper
  - trash
  - plastic
* To enable a more interactive experience encomapassed by the UI of the web app by using an AI Chatbot that asks the user about the material being scanned which is then separated for easier disposal.
* To incentivize the user by providing NFTs(Non-fungible tokens) after certain milestones that depend upon the amount of items scanned.

##  Frameworks Used
The web app was developed using a multitude of frameworks, APIs, and programming languages to implement each aspect of the project. These are as follows:
* Streamlit
* React
* FastAPI
* Cohere API
* SQLalchemy
* Tailwind CSS
* Javascript
* Keras
* Tensorflow
* HTML
* Python

  ## Project Development
  Includes an informative web page about the project, that it, WasteBot AI and our goals as well as other useful information. This has been implemented using HTML, CSS, and Javascript while the backend
  has been mainly implemented using FastAPI. The chatbot that allows for seamless user experience has been developed using Streamlit and Cohere API. These are integrated together to allow for the completion
  of the project.
